For the backend functionality, I implemented the game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe. The website is communicating with the server using AJAX. It sends the state of the game board, which the server then uses to make a choice. For now, it simply chooses a random blank tile, but, in the future, I would like to expand on this and add a more advanced AI. Moreover, it also updates the current user's game statistics once the game is over. These changes can then be seen on the user's profile page. The server sends back either the end game status (win, loss, tie) or the tile it chose.

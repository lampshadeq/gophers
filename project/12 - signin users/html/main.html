    Welcome back to T3! This is the main navigational page. From here,
    you can view your profile to see the information you provided to
    us when you registered as well game statistics. The second link
    allows you to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against our machine (you're
    going to lose). Once you get tired of losing, feel free to sign out
    with the third link.
    
    There are more features that need to be added! This includes player
    vs. player games, customization of your profile, and, of course, a
    fighting chance against our awesome AI.
